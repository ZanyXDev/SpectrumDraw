# SpectrumDraw
A tool for making music that draws an image in the spectrogram.



TODO
------
- Style grid to seemless space
- arrange tracks by frequency on the grid
- seek and play at different parts
- keep the labels visible (in separate grid thing, with scroll area over that)
- change instrument (square, triangle, etc) (to allow for thicker lines)
- Styling
- Controls
- Pretty much everything
